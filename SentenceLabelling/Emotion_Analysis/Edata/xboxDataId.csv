139242149,ANSW,OP, @euanmcgraw I see.
139242149,REQ,OP, What does the light on the power brick do when this happens?
153914763,ANSW,OP,@XboxSupport2 when it turns off it has 4 light green lights around the power button
139242149,THK,OP," @euanmcgraw Okay, thanks."
139242149,REQ,OP, What about the light on the power supply?
153914763,ANSW,OP,@XboxSupport2 it just stays green!
139242149,ANSW,OP, @euanmcgraw Interesting.
139242149,REQ,OP, What kind of A/V connection are you using?
153914763,ANSW,OP,@XboxSupport2 normal hdmi cable
139242149,REQ,OP, @euanmcgraw Would you be able to try with a composite or component cable?
153914763,ANSW,OP,@XboxSupport2 still the same outcome :(
139242149,ANSW,OP, @euanmcgraw Darn.
139242149,REQ,OP," Okay, how about just plugging the console into a different outlet?"
153914763,ANSW,SV,@XboxSupport2 at the moment its working but if it re occurs later I shall tweet again thanks a lot for your help!

139242149,REQ,OP, @JKArcade Have you been able to try plugging it in a different USB port?
16549467,ANSW,OP,"@XboxSupport2 I have a free one on the front that I use for my Turtle Beach stuff, I will swap it out for the Kinect here in a moment."
139242149,REQ,OP," @JKArcade If you're using additional devices like Turtle Beach, we also would want to test with them disconnected to make sure."
16549467,ANSW,OP," @XboxSupport2 no prob, lemme disconnect the headset, everything else is unplugged as is."
16549467,ANSW,OP, Going to use the front USB port.
139242149,RCPT,OP," @JKArcade Sounds good, keep us updated."
16549467,ANSW,OP,"@XboxSupport2 the Kinect appears to be working now, however I'm not thrilled if the implication is my headset or USB port is responsible."
139242149,ANSW,OP," @JKArcade Totally understand, why don't we try one at a time to help determine it."
139242149,REQ,OP, Maybe try the back USB port now and see first.
16549467,REQ,OP,"@XboxSupport2 Sure thing, should I power off the console while I switch?"
139242149,ANSW,OP," @JKArcade Yeah, let's go ahead and try that."
16549467,ANSW,OP," @XboxSupport2 Rear port result: Before even being able to sign in, the Kinect started rebooting itself repeatedly."
16549467,ANSW,OP, It's looping reboots.
139242149,REQ,OP, @JKArcade Can you clarify whether you're a part of the dashboard preview program or not?
16549467,ANSW,OP,"@XboxSupport2 In addition, the Kinect has now started rebooting again using the rear port, interrupting Fruit Ninja."
139242149,RCPT,OP, @JKArcade So...
139242149,REQ,OP," to clarify, how long have you owned the sensor?"
16549467,ANSW,OP,@XboxSupport2 I purchased the sensor the week it launched.
139242149,REQ,OP, @JKArcade And it's worked fine until the last couple of days?
139242149,REQ,OP, Only very recent issues?
16549467,ANSW,OP,"@XboxSupport2 Literally up until the other night when I wrote in, it's been perfect."
139242149,RCPT,OP, @JKArcade Hrmm.
139242149,ANSW,OP," Okay, it's likely that the sensor may need to be repaired."
139242149,REQ,OP, Any possibility of testing it with a friend's console?
16549467,REQ,OP,"@XboxSupport2 Not really, could it be the USB cable rather than the sensor?"
139242149,ANSW,OP, @JKArcade That is certainly a possibility.
139242149,ANSW,OP," Comes down to an issue with the console, the Kinect sensor or the USB cable at this point."
16549467,REQ,OP,@XboxSupport2 Is it possible for me to replace the USB cable for the Kinect sensor?

525441739,REQ,OP, @XboxSupport2 should I stop being a cowboy fan cuz they are bad.

128727325,ANSW,OP, I got it like in 2009?
128727325,ANSW,OP, I don't think it being old has anything to with it though.
139242149,ANSW,OP," @KidZombie209 I know, was just curious."
139242149,ANSW,OP, You can always get a repair request done here if you need to: http://t.co/38GhGnYY ^BB
128727325,ANSW,OP,"@XboxSupport2 it's okay, I just disassembled it and it turns out, there was a Disc stuck in the try."

368685556,ANSW,OP, But I will try again
139242149,ANSW,OP," @Lukejohns12 The idea is to try storing the game to a different part of the hard drive, so that may help resolve the issue."

609391892,,, @XboxSupport2 I can still do that.
609391892,,, The dlc is on a thumdrive and the game files are on a hardrive So if I remove the thumdrive I can do that
139242149,,," @GunnMcCabe Hmm, have you tried storing the DLC on the same device as the rest of the game files?"

139239482,,, @MilitantBoBz Are you currently on a wired or wireless connection?
277135985,,,@XboxSupport1 wired

139239482,,, @JKArcade So this interrupts mid game correct?
16549467,,,"@XboxSupport1 that's correct, in fact, it just turned off on its own."
139239482,,,"@JKArcade Yep, at the Microsoft Store http://t.co/hEOzOomd  ^JD"
16549467,,,"@XboxSupport1 If I plug my Turtle Beach X32's into the rear USB port and they work, would that be proof enough that it's the sensor/cable?"
139239482,,,@JKArcade That'd be a good step to try - it would help isolate the issue ^JD
16549467,,,"@XboxSupport1 Alright, I'm going to make dinner, but I will write back shortly."
139239482,,,@JKArcade Sounds good ^JD
16549467,,, @XboxSupport1 My Turtle Beach's and all my wireless headsets work flawlessly running/charging from the rear USB port....
16549467,,, given that (1/2)
16549467,,,"@XboxSupport1 given that the Kinect works out of the front USB and sometimes from the rear, tells me that it's probably the sensor itself."
139239482,,, @JKArcade So you requested to have the label dropped off by FedEx?
16549467,,," @XboxSupport1 I chose the option said ""FedEx Drop Off"", maybe I misunderstood?"
16549467,,, Can you clarify please?
139239482,,," @JKArcade To clarify, when did you submit the repair?"
16549467,,,"@XboxSupport1 just a moment ago, I assumed the label would be a download."
139239482,,, @JKArcade You may want to check the status here: http://t.co/gJS8ilNW Sounds like you may have requested to have the label shipped.
16549467,,,"@XboxSupport1 I must have misunderstood the options then, will an entire box show up or just the label?"

139239482,,,@DisposableHero8 Can you clear the console cache and redownload your profile http://t.co/Yy3otP6R http://t.co/8kgMMGik ^PJ

288135274,,,"@XboxSupport1 Alright, if I've turn off my console and the put it on the next time the download will begin from where it stopped??"
139239482,,, @RohitJagasia1 It may need to start over.

139239482,,, @Lukejohns12 What title was this?
368685556,,," @XboxSupport1 FIFA 13 , it's happened with other games that I PAID FOR aswell."
368685556,,," I've had the same re download, clear system which doesnt work"
139239482,,, @Lukejohns12 How much free space do you have on your hard drive?
368685556,,,@XboxSupport1 100gb is free
139239482,,," @Lukejohns12 Can you remove the demo, download an item of similar size and then redownload the demo?"
368685556,,,"@XboxSupport1 I've been told that before and didn't work, also it takes ages to  Download"
139239482,,, @Lukejohns12 Was that with the other title or with the demo today?
368685556,,,"@XboxSupport1 others but I've been told loads of times and not worked,"
139239482,,, @Lukejohns12 It may still be worth a try.
139239482,,, What is the exact message you see again?
368685556,,,@XboxSupport1 Disk is unreadable please clean with a cloth.....
139239482,,, @Lukejohns12 It sounds like doing those steps may help.
368685556,,, @XboxSupport1 but I can't clean a downloaded game???
368685556,,, It's the error which normally happens with scratched game.
139239482,,, @Lukejohns12 That is correct.
139239482,,, Which is why those steps can help.
368685556,,, @XboxSupport1 do you mean the disk is unreadable steps?
368685556,,, It says clean scratched disk but I can't Because it is downloaded on my hardrive
139239482,,," @Lukejohns12 We meant removing it from the console, downloading something of similar size and then redownloading."
368685556,,,@XboxSupport1 ok then but it probably won't work
139239482,,, @Lukejohns12 Do let us know how it goes.
368685556,,,"@XboxSupport1 downloaded something similar and still doesn't work, Sick of this now, just me that it happens angry http://t.co/dxVFmFUn"
139239482,,, @Lukejohns12 What storage device is the game on?
368685556,,,"@XboxSupport1 hardrive, other games I downloaded the to fill the space don't work either :("
139239482,,, @Lukejohns12 Do you have a USB flashdrive you can try loading the game from?
368685556,,,"@XboxSupport1 yes plugged it, I tried to move it but said cannot perform action"
139239482,,, @Lukejohns12 Is the flashdrive set up for use with the console?
368685556,,,"@XboxSupport1 yes in configured it,   And Of course my FIFA doesn't work, just give my xbox a thump, it's going down the stairs soon."
368685556,,,@XboxSupport1 yes
139239482,,, @Lukejohns12 If you remove the hard drive (with the console off) can you download direct to the thumbdrive?
368685556,,,@XboxSupport1 no the only option is memory unit
139239482,,, @Lukejohns12 Can you give that a try to see if that works?
368685556,,,@XboxSupport1 my memory unit does not have enough memory
139239482,,, @Lukejohns12 What size is the thumbdrive?
368685556,,,@XboxSupport1 it is 3 gb but it does not let me select it only let's me select my built in memory unit which is 100 mb
139239482,,, @Lukejohns12 And the flashdrive does not either?
139239482,,, @Lukejohns12 To move or to download the content again?
368685556,,,@XboxSupport1 both
139239482,,, @Lukejohns12 How much free space does the flashdrive currently show?
368685556,,,"@XboxSupport1 3gb, I think it's just my hardrive, I had some of these problems before but they always got fixed, now nothin i download works"
139239482,,, @Lukejohns12 How long have you owned the console?
368685556,,,@XboxSupport1 2 years
139239482,,, @Lukejohns12 It sounds like the console may be outside of its warranty period but it may be in need of repair.
368685556,,,@XboxSupport1 I've deleted some other stuff on my HD and redownloaded
139239482,,," @Lukejohns12 Okay, let us know."
368685556,,,@XboxSupport1 im putting a good review in for you
139239482,,, @Lukejohns12 That is up to you.

139239482,,," @Thee_TriiGGa Alright, cool."
139239482,,," Where does the wireless connection stop when you try to get on Live, exactly?"
466661985,,," @XboxSupport1 at the very first step, nearly right away."
466661985,,," it has a constant red light and says ""test failed..."
466661985,,," can't connect to wireless"""
139239482,,, @Thee_TriiGGa Okay.
139239482,,," Is it an N router, perhaps?"
466661985,,,@XboxSupport1 not sure what that means
466661985,,," @XboxSupport1 okay i know what that means, but where would i find that info?"
466661985,,, on the router itself?
139239482,,, @Thee_TriiGGa It's a way that the router broadcasts the wireless.
139239482,,," If it's using an N signal, the white adapter won't be able to connect ^PC"
466661985,,,"@XboxSupport1 that's probably the exact issue then, what's the best way to go about getting connected wirelessly then?"
139239482,,, @Thee_TriiGGa The info would either be on the router or in its settings.
139239482,,, There's a newer model of adapter that can handle N networks (c.
139239482,,, )^PC
139239482,,,@Thee_TriiGGa This guy - http://t.co/eM7BNog9 It works a bit better in general ^PC
466661985,,,@XboxSupport1 would that be the black one?
466661985,,, @XboxSupport1 ok...
466661985,,, looks like i'll have to invest in that.
466661985,,, thanks so much for the help and info!
139239482,,, @Thee_TriiGGa You're welcome.
139239482,,," Alternatively, you may be able to change what the router broadcasts at."
139239482,,," N is the best, though ^PC"

81466943,,,"@XboxSupport1 No joy, disc drive kept opening when I shut it, and when I finally shut it - it says 'opening' again :/"

139239482,,, @Arran_bell Would you be able to move the console to test with a wired network?
399664645,,,@XboxSupport1 not untill tomorow but the wired network could not be permanent
139239482,,, @Arran_bell That's fine.
139239482,,, It would still be a good thing to test.
399664645,,,@XboxSupport1 is there a way to get back in contact directly to the issue tomorow as I'm sure you get 1000's of issue's per hour?
139239482,,, @Arran_bell Sure!

139239482,,," @Arran_bell Cool, much obliged!"
399664645,,,@XboxSupport1 i have moved my xbox to a wired connection and can connect fine to people i think it is due to the placement of my xbox/signal
139239482,,, @Arran_bell Could be possible.
139239482,,, Anyway to move the console and the router closer to each other?
399664645,,,@XboxSupport1 I can't move it from where the aerial cable comes through the ceiling :/ certain spots I can place my TV
139239482,,," @Arran_bell Just to be sure, is your router on this list of compatible hardware?"

139239482,,," @Arran_bell ok, how many walls and/or ceilings pass does the signal pass through?"
399664645,,,@XboxSupport1 1 ceiling and 2 walls
139239482,,, @Arran_bell Can you run a speed test on another wireless device near your console?
399664645,,,@XboxSupport1 ran the speed test on my laptop currently am recieving 11 megabytes per second
139239482,,, @Arran_bell Is that upload or download?
399664645,,,@XboxSupport1 download my upload is 1.9 mbps
139239482,,," @Arran_bell Hmm, okay."
139239482,,," Since initially moving the console away from the satellite, have you run a connection test?"
399664645,,,@XboxSupport1 yes i daily check my download speed to check how bad the lag may be whilst online
139239482,,," @Arran_bell Alright, and how are your speeds?"
139239482,,," Can you send us the actual link to the http://t.co/edgLK7RI test, please?"

139239482,,," Keep us posted, please."

139239482,,, @Arran_bell Did you run the speed test from a device nearby the Xbox?
399664645,,,@XboxSupport1 yep i ran it on my laptop which is less than a metre from my xbox
139239482,,, @Arran_bell How far is the console from the router now?
399664645,,,@XboxSupport1 still the same 1 story and goes through 2 walls but it is closer to the router within the room
139239482,,, @Arran_bell Have you opened your router's ports manually?
139239482,,, http://t.co/2ccwVINP ^LB
399664645,,,@XboxSupport1 i tried to do this after the xbox was moved and i kept getting the error with opening the ports :/
139239482,,," @Arran_bell To clarify, you get an error connecting or you got an error when trying to open the ports?"
399664645,,,@XboxSupport1 when i try to open the ports it tells me the port does not exist
139239482,,," @Arran_bell And you're following the steps in the guide, one by one?"
399664645,,,@XboxSupport1 yep i retried about 4 times the ports kept saying they did not exist
139239482,,, @Arran_bell Can you contact your ISP for help with opening your router's ports up?
399664645,,,@XboxSupport1 i wouldnt know how to and im not the owner of the house so i wouldnt be in the good books if i was to mess around with it lol
139239482,,, @Arran_bell Can you and the person who owns your internet service contact the ISP?
399664645,,,@XboxSupport1 i asked if i could but they said no :(
139239482,,, @Arran_bell They said no?
139239482,,, They're not willing to help call your ISP?
399664645,,,@XboxSupport1 they said that they had recently bought the XL broadband so we shouldnt need to according to them
139239482,,," @Arran_bell Who is ""they""."
139239482,,," Do you live at home, on a campus, etc.?"
139239482,,, Is the router easily accessible?

399664645,,,@XboxSupport1 yep they can all connect to one another its only me who can only connect to certain people and i also have trouble hosting
139239482,,," @Arran_bell Well, it's dd that one of the important ports for LIVE can't be opened..."
139239482,,, that may be part of the issue.
139239482,,, It would really...
139239482,,, @Arran_bell ...
139239482,,, very likely help to contact your ISP and ask them for help on opening the ports that are described in the guide we sent.
399664645,,,@XboxSupport1 what are the post numbers i will try to open them again

521864057,,, I got online around 3pm.
139239482,,, @LiKE_a_BAUS_x That is odd.
139239482,,, We'd recommend keeping and eye on it and letting us know if it continues to be trouble for you.
521864057,,, @XboxSupport1 I'm not sure if its a hack or a bug but I got put in another 16 player lobby again.
521864057,,, Lobby turned into Hardcore Ricochet: CTF

101944738,,,@XboxSupport1 Now its to the point where I can log on but it'll kick me out of games and then soon disconnect from xbox live giving me L's
139239482,,, @KaeGuevara Alright.
139239482,,, Last we saw the test was failing before reaching the network.
139239482,,, Is that still happening now?
101944738,,, @XboxSupport1 I just signed back in..
101944738,,, its working now but its not consistant..
101944738,,, I'm losing games because of this and it always doesnt connect
101944738,,,@XboxSupport1 do I need to manually configure my router or something
139239482,,," @KaeGuevara You're on a wireless connection, right?"
139239482,,, Would you be able to try a wired one temporarily?
101944738,,,@XboxSupport1 Na I wouldnt be able to the way my router and modem isnt close to it
139239482,,, @KaeGuevara Okay.
139239482,,, About how many walls/ceilings would a straight line between the console and router go through?
101944738,,, @XboxSupport1 None..
101944738,,, its in the same room..
101944738,,, just in the corner somewhere else
139239482,,," @KaeGuevara OK, is your router on this list of compatible hardware?"

101944738,,,"@XboxSupport1 Now all of a sudden its acting up but the net on my laptops are perfect, full bars so I was thinking it was just XBL"
139239482,,," @KaeGuevara OK, does it have the most recent firmware update?"
101944738,,, @XboxSupport1 Maybe not..
101944738,,, check through the control panel?
139239482,,," @KaeGuevara Yes, or you can refer to the router manufacturer."
101944738,,, @XboxSupport1 Idk where that is..
101944738,,, Is this a common problem?
101944738,,, @XboxSupport1 But if that was the issue then my laptops wouldnt be working in the house..
101944738,,, I think its my internal wifi that went bad
139239482,,, @KaeGuevara Routers on that list are proven to work with Windows computers and Xbox consoles.
139239482,,, It may be affecting the connection issues.
139239482,,, @KaeGuevara It's hard to speculate on that.
139239482,,, We recommend using an tested network device.

139239482,,, @HackedByFixis You could contact them inquiring about that.
139239482,,, We wouldn't be able to give that to you here on Twitter.

139239482,,, @BradShrewsbury Was it redeemed successfully?
30868632,,,@XboxSupport1 It said it redeemed a 12 month pre paid card :S
139239482,,," @BradShrewsbury Ok, what does it say next to your account when you sign into http://t.co/da0mulu2 ?"
30868632,,,@XboxSupport1 when I go on my account it says this - Prepaid 12M Xbox LIVE Gold - It also says gold member on the top right about a third in
139239482,,, @BradShrewsbury OK looks like it should be fine then.
139239482,,, Can you clear the console cache and redownload your profile again?
30868632,,,@XboxSupport1 It seems to be working now :P thank you :D

139239482,,, @SPL1TSECSH00TER Done!
139239482,,," If there's anything we can assist you with, do let us know."
139239482,,, Thanks.
421594513,,,@XboxSupport1 not sure if you can point me in the right direction on whose end the issue is on
139239482,,, @SPL1TSECSH00TER Would you be able to send us your results from http://t.co/edgLK7RI real quick?
421594513,,,"@XboxSupport1 ping 36 ms, download speed 45.63 Mbps, upload speed 5.87 Mbps"
139239482,,," @SPL1TSECSH00TER Alright, thanks."
139239482,,," That looks good, perhaps you're just being matched up with people whose connections aren't so good ^PC"
421594513,,,"@XboxSupport1 alright, that's what I thought but it seems to happen everyday, no matter what lobby I'm in"
139239482,,," @SPL1TSECSH00TER Hmm, do other games seem to have a better connection?"
421594513,,,@XboxSupport1 my Xbox is only about 3 months old at the most
139239482,,, @SPL1TSECSH00TER So MW3 is the only game where you're seeing a bad connection?
421594513,,,"@XboxSupport1 No, I sold MW3 because it was so bad, I still have a bad connection on black ops but it's way more playable"
139239482,,, @SPL1TSECSH00TER What about a non-Call of Duty game?
421594513,,,"@XboxSupport1 I don't really play any other online MP games, just skyrim but there wouldn't be any issues with Internet lag with that"
139239482,,, @SPL1TSECSH00TER Fair enough.
139239482,,, Have you already seen/been through the steps here?
139239482,,, http://t.co/MWz61HaV They might help ^PC
421594513,,,"@XboxSupport1 I've tried almost all of those, but I will try a hardwire connection later today, downside is I bought a new xbox for wireless"
139239482,,, @SPL1TSECSH00TER It might be that the wireless signal is a bit weak.
139239482,,, How many walls/ceilings would be between the router and console?
421594513,,,@XboxSupport1 it's literally about 6 inches from the router and modem
139239482,,," @SPL1TSECSH00TER Hmm, are there many other wireless things in the area?"
421594513,,, @XboxSupport1 using my connection??
421594513,,, Just my phone and my wireless is password protected
139239482,,," @SPL1TSECSH00TER Not just connected to the router, I'm thinking about things that may be interfering with the signal."
421594513,,,"@XboxSupport1 there shouldn't be anything else running off of it, laptops are off and the desktop is also turned off"
139239482,,," @SPL1TSECSH00TER This may sound weird, but is there a microwave nearby?"
421594513,,,"@XboxSupport1 there is one about 15 feet away, and yes that does sound weird :-/ haha"
139239482,,," @SPL1TSECSH00TER It's not just because I'm hungry, honest."
139239482,,, Does unplugging it make any difference?
139239482,,, They can actually interfere with WiFi ^PC
421594513,,,"@XboxSupport1 totally made a difference, that you so much, especially because u used the better part of your day helping me, thanks again"
139239482,,, @SPL1TSECSH00TER Awesome!

139239482,,, @Zobernuts you're getting disconnected from Xbox LIVE?
290660713,,, @XboxSupport1 yes that's correct.
290660713,,," I'll be online playing CoD then suddenly I'll be ""Disconnected From Xbox Live"" for no reason."
139239482,,," @Zobernuts go ahead and reset the router and modem, see if that'll help."
139239482,,, @Zobernuts can you try to run a direct connection to the modem to see if that'll still occur?
290660713,,,"@XboxSupport1 it's not my Internet connection, someone has my IP address and is booting me."

139239482,,, @CA5CADA Thanks for the heads up!
139239482,,, Did you have any Xbox support related questions?

15779962,,," @XboxSupport1 I clear my cache often, but I'll do it again."
15779962,,, Now I'm supposed to delete my profile and redownload it?
15779962,,, How will that help?
139239482,,," @Heazie Don't delete the profile, just re-download it."
139239482,,, Deleting it first is not recommended.
15779962,,, @XboxSupport1 Did not help at all.
15779962,,, And still when I press A to watch a movie in my HD-DVD player it just clicks on the tile and nothing.
139239482,,," @Heazie To clarify, is it only disc-based games that take a while to load?"
139239482,,, Or even digital copies?
15779962,,," @XboxSupport1 Disc, digital, apps, whatever, screen goes black for much too long."
15779962,,," Whole system loads slow even for lists (Quickplay, etc)."
139239482,,," @Heazie if you remove your HDD, to discs run faster?"
15779962,,," @XboxSupport1 I've never removed my Hard Drive, I don't know why I would."
15779962,,, I have a 320 installed.
15779962,,, This all started about 1 month ago.
139239482,,, @Heazie Can you try with the hard drive removed?
139239482,,, http://t.co/8Gu5o3mf ^PJ
15779962,,,"@XboxSupport1 It loaded a little bit faster, I was on a different profile, though, one that has no history of use."
139239482,,, @Heazie Are you able to try with your hard drive?
15779962,,," @XboxSupport1 Well, of course, I can put it back in."
15779962,,, Should I use my normal profile or the new one I just used?
139239482,,, @Heazie The new one you just used please.
139239482,,, Then try your regular profile again.
15779962,,," @XboxSupport1 New profile games seem to load quicker, though I only cam try Hexic &amp; a disc game."
15779962,,, Old 1 games still take a long time and
139239482,,, @Heazie How long have you owned your Xbox &amp; did you buy it new?
15779962,,,"@XboxSupport1 I've owned it since November '11, brand new system."
139239482,,, @Heazie You are not noticing a difference with the hard drive installed or not?
15779962,,,"@XboxSupport1 Without the HDD it seemed to load quicker with my new profile, overall the system runs very slowly, for everything."
139239482,,, @Heazie How much free space do you have on that hard drive?
15779962,,,"@XboxSupport1 48 gigs, give or take."

139239482,,, @wes_clement Have you changed your GT recently?

14231523,,," before it was the whoops something is wrong message, 5 others confirmed"
139239482,,, @rogXue Might have just been a quick hiccup.
139239482,,, Are you able to redeem points now?
14231523,,,"@XboxSupport1 yeah was able to redeem a code fine, it's been happening off and on for the past week or two though."
139239482,,, @rogXue Have you cleared your browser cache recently?
14231523,,, @XboxSupport1 like I said not only me when it happens.
14231523,,, Surprised you haven't received more mentions on it.
139239482,,," @rogXue Like I said, may have just been a quick hiccup."

805683253,,,@XboxSupport1 http://t.co/QJ6Y1Lqh
139239482,,, @RarityBased Did you have any Xbox questions that we can help with today?

139239482,,, @EatTheBugs Do you have a different TV you can test the Xbox on?
532773444,,, @XboxSupport1 no.
532773444,,, But other devices feeding to HDMI ports deliver video to screen.
139239482,,," @EatTheBugs Ok, but can you test the Xbox on a different TV just as a test?"
139239482,,, It's common in this issue to try that.
532773444,,, @XboxSupport1 Ok.
532773444,,, Will need to do that later.
139239482,,, @EatTheBugs No problem.
139239482,,, Give it a shot when you can and let us know if the video works.
532773444,,, @XboxSupport1 the component video cable works to the tv.
532773444,,, But the quality isnâ€™t nearly as good as HDMI â€¦
139239482,,," @EatTheBugs OK, so it may be an HDMI issue with the console."
139239482,,, Were you able to test on another TV as well?
532773444,,,"@XboxSupport1 not yet, but as Iâ€™ve said, same HDMI cable on another device works to TV, hence itâ€™s the Xbox."
139239482,,, @EatTheBugs We'd recommend trying with a different TV prior to sending it off for repair.
139239482,,, (In case it is an issue wit the TV)^JC
532773444,,,"@XboxSupport1 I do hear you say to test on another TV, so there is no need to repeat the suggestion."
139239482,,," @EatTheBugs My apologies, just wanted to exhaust that step before you send your console away for a couple weeks without isolating issue."
532773444,,, @XboxSupport1 I understand.
532773444,,, And I know others fail to actually do suggestions.
532773444,,, I just need an opportunity to arrange taking my Xbox to a tv.
139239482,,, @EatTheBugs Definitely understand that.
139239482,,, Is console under warranty?
139239482,,, (Can check on repair link here: http://t.co/gJS8ilNW )^JC
532773444,,,"@XboxSupport1 yes, until 2014"
139239482,,, @EatTheBugs Cool.
139239482,,, Then the repair would be free.
139239482,,," So if can't try with diff TV, doesn't hurt to send it off for repair."

139239482,,, @RoflProcter Are you able to sign in on http://t.co/da0mulu2?

351889123,,, @XboxSupport1 It's happening with partys like I disconnect from partys but able to rejoin again.
351889123,,, So I assume it will happen with other games
139239482,,, @RedBloodSierra Are you getting an error code?

351889123,,, It said others left the party but they did not.
139239482,,, @RedBloodSierra Do you still get disconnected when you run a wired connection?
351889123,,, @XboxSupport1 I can't run a wired connection.
351889123,,, I am able to reconnect the party &amp; game pretty much in 1 sec after disconnecting.

139239482,,," @MarcSuckling Hmm, perhaps try clearing the console's system cache, restart and try again again?"

139239482,,, @MarcSuckling What's the name of the DLC that you deleted in order for Collection 4 to work?
499217801,,,@XboxSupport1 I deleted Arctic Recon for an example but it works if I delete any other DLC map whether it be multiplayer or Spec Ops
139239482,,," @MarcSuckling Quick clarifier, are you downloading the DLC from the Games Marketplace on console or from the MW3 store in game?"
499217801,,,@XboxSupport1 MW3 store in game like it said on the website

49145460,,, I just find it frustrating that every month those recently reduced items take FOREVER to appear.
139239482,,," @PriusGuy2004 Yeah, I definitely hear you."

139239482,,, @aVex501 Was this a one time thing or does it seem to happen over and over again?
459414000,,,@XboxSupport1 Happens constantly.
139239482,,, @aVex501 Is this with only game invites or does any other thing cause freezing issues?
459414000,,, @XboxSupport1 No matter who sends it and with any game.
459414000,,," Mw2, Mw3, Cod4, BF3."
139239482,,, @aVex501 Are you able to send and receive regular text messages with no issues?
459414000,,, @XboxSupport1 Yep.
459414000,,, I can join game sessions and message just fine.
459414000,,, My only problem is trying to join from dashboard.
139239482,,," @aVex501 And that is join game sessions in progress and not party chats, right?"
459414000,,,@XboxSupport1 Any game invite including partys.
139239482,,,"@aVex501 Let's try restarting the console, clearing your cache: http://t.co/Yy3otP6R and re-DL the gamertag: http://t.co/8kgMMGik ^AC"
459414000,,,@XboxSupport1 Just tried all of that and was still able to recreate by having a friend inviting me into a game while I am on Dashboard.
139239482,,," @aVex501 If you are in the game as opposed to on the dashboard, does it then not freeze?"
459414000,,,@XboxSupport1 That is correct.
139239482,,," @aVex501 Okay, does the issue persist if logged in to a different account on your Xbox?"
459414000,,, @XboxSupport1 Yes.
459414000,,, Its the same on friends consoles as well.
139239482,,," @aVex501 Okay, let's try removing your hard drive and re-downloading your profile to a USB drive and then please give that another try."
459414000,,, @XboxSupport1 Wouldn't that void the warranty on my slim?
459414000,,, Just wanna be clear before I try this.
139239482,,, @aVex501 Nope.
139239482,,, You can find instructions for removing the hard drive here.
139239482,,, http://t.co/P0pgvd79 ^AD
459414000,,, @XboxSupport1 The problem still persists.

139239482,,, Are you currently part of the dashboard public beta program?
459414000,,,@XboxSupport1 I am not.
139239482,,, @aVex501 When you tried this on a different console did you re-download your profile over LIVE or movie it via USB?
459414000,,,@XboxSupport1 I tried it on a friends xbox/account.
139239482,,," @aVex501 So to clarify, you logged in to your gamertag using your credentials on your friend's console?"
459414000,,, @XboxSupport1 No.
459414000,,, He tried it on his xbox as well from his account.
459414000,,, Seems to be a common problem.
139239482,,, @aVex501 So your friend is having the same issue as you?
139239482,,, Or your friend used your account on his Xbox?
459414000,,,@XboxSupport1 friends are having the same issue with their own accounts and xboxs.
